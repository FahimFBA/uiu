## üôè Support everyone by providing resources (Questions / Video Clips) you have. Send a mail to [fahimbinamin@gmail.com](mailto:fahimbinamin@gmail.com) with the resources or anything necessary for the students.

## üéØ We don't support unethical tasks; therefore if any faculty wants to remove his/her resources, of course, we will remove that instantly.

<br>

## ‚û°Ô∏è Until the whole list is getting updated, use the google sheets managed by one of our brothers, [Md Robayet Ahasan Rifat](https://www.facebook.com/greatrifatt): [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ucoxBUG-Cf2zbpE71ehRNK5pEpmnpctLlaWasJu0faM/edit#gid=2111826296)
